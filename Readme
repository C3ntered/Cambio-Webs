# Cambio Card Game
This is an open-source project for a card game I learned about while I was in college. The game is simple yet unique because it requires you to remember not only your cards but also others', using a bit of luck and skill to score the lowest hand.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML (Front-end), Python (Back-end), Google Jules (Aiding in rewriting code and debugging + writing the logic), and Cursor (Writing the JS and HTML).

I initially started by working on the framework. I knew I wanted to make a website for this card game because it would be readily accessible. I have experience with Python, so I knew I wanted to use that as the backend. I then had to create a bridge using JS (This was all written via AI. I aided in debugging and rewriting when things broke).

Then it came to actually writing the game, I knew I wanted a deck of 54 cards (including Jokers), so I created lists to act as the deck, which held card objects. Then created the rules with the help of AI to write and debug the game logic. 

## Lessons Learned:

I got to be more hands-on with python learning how to bridge it with websockets and FastAPI, trying to make sure everything tied well with each other. I also got to experiment with multiple AIs, learning how to prompt them and how to review their code to push onto GitHub.
